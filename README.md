# Practical ggplot2

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/wilkelab/isoband.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wilkelab/isoband)

The R package ggplot2 provides a powerful and flexible approach to data
visualization, and it is suitable both for rapid exploration of
different visualization approaches and for producing carefully crafted
publication-quality figures. However, getting ggplot2 to make figures
that look exactly the way you want them to can sometimes be challenging,
and beginners and experts alike can get confused by themes, scales,
coords, guides, or facets. This repository houses a set of step-by-step
examples demonstrating how to get the most out of ggplot2, including how
to choose and customize scales, how to theme plots, and when and how to
use extension packages.

The examples shown are based on the book [“Fundamentals of Data
Visualization.”](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz) However, there are
minor differences between the figures here and the ones in the book.
Most importantly, the book uses the Myriad Pro font family, which is not
freely available. I have also cleaned up the ggplot2 code where
appropriate, and I have made adjustments to font and figure sizes so the
figures look appropriate in the default R Markdown html style.

## Installation
